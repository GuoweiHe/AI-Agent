nuigood niuOn a sunny morning, a curious cow named Mabel wandered from the barn to the meadow. She found a patch of clover and watched butterflies drift by. The wind carried the soft sound of a distant river, and Mabel wondered what lies beyond the hill. She took a slow step, then another, and soon the whole field seemed to glow with colors. A friendly dog trotted over and wagged its tail, inviting her to follow to a hidden grove where berries grew. They shared a quiet moment, listening to the rustle of leaves and the distant song of birds. When the sun began to dip, Mabel trotted back home, feeling brave and full of new stories to tell the herd.
